Level 1: Create a simple DevOps pipeline including a code repository server, a CI/build server, a test server, and a prod. server.

Level 2: Complete task 1 and Add instrumentation to the prod server which can gather stats on server performance.

Level 3: Complete task 2 and deploy a simple application using the DevOps pipeline. Verify that your application works accurately and is accessible.

Level 4: Complete task 3 and test the automation scripts by changing the source code to trigger a deferred or automatic deployment of the new build.
